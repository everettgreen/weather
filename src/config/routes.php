/**
 * All routes may be defined here.  Routes have the following syntax:
 * Router::route($orig_uri, $mapped_uri);
 *
 * For example:
 * Router::route("foo/bar", "bar/foo");
 *
 * The above route maps the "foo" controller and "bar" method to the "bar"
 * controller and "foo" method.
 *
 * Each parenthesized regular expression in the first parameter can be used in
 * the second parameter by calling the $[numeric value] of that statement. For
 * example: $1, $2, ... $n.
